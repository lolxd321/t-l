          Why do I have to pay for reading messages?
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      As you can see, we have no advertisements or pop-ups on our site, we don't make money out of that. At the same time, we invest a lot to attract new members. We could not exist without income that is collected from premium members. That's why you have to pay if you want to read and send messages.

      What is the aim/purpose of this site?
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    Our goal is to connect people with a passion for travel from all around the world. Most of them seek a traveling partner and exchange their traveling experiences while others look for a job or specific adventures. Usually girls expect to travel but sometimes they expect foreign travelers to visit to their country. We recommend to communicate with members individually to find out what they are looking for.
